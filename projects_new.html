                    to the 3D Mario Bros. games. The main requirements for this project were writing shaders, writing
                    our own physics and collisions systems, figuring out a 2D pipeline to overlay on the screen,
                    importing 3D models and getting them to animate, having powerups, as well as implementing an editor
                    and saving/loading levels to/from JSON (and having Polish, of course).

                <p class="project-text mt-3 center">This is a mod for the game Quake 4, putting a few League of Legends
                    mechanics and abilities in the game. There are 5 different classes,
                    each with two upgradable abilities. The player also gains experience and gold upon killing enemies.
                    I had to repurpose code from Quake 4's multiplayer source code in order to bring up a buy menu,
                    normally never possible in single player. This was my first project completed at NJIT and I'm very
                    proud of it considering my lack of experience prior.

                <p class="project-text mt-3 center">This is a project I worked on for my educational software design
                    class at NJIT. Using Unity, I made a tool to educate what minions are, their purpose, and how to
                    last hit them in League of Legends. Different from my game dev class projects, this one was designed
                    first to be educational, second to be a game.

                <h6 class="text-center"><em>There is no page for this project yet.</em></h6>
                <p class="project-text mt-3 center mb-5">Currently a work-in-progress, this tool hopes to let a user
                    mod in their own per-chroma particles. In League of Legends, there are many cosmetic skins. Some of
                    these skins have "chroma"s. These chromas change the color of the base model and mostly every other
                    texture used. However, they <b>rarely</b> change the colors of any particle emitters. This leads to
                    some chromas clashing with their base particles and I don't think it looks very pleasing. While
                    Riot Games probably keeps the particles the same for readability, I want to give the player the
                    option of making their cosmetics look even better. Currently, this is written in python but I'm in
                    the process of moving the code over to JavaScript for better front-end production. I've figured out
                    the data structures for League of Legends particle emitters and currently have code that can extract
                    the colors and keep a reference to where they are in the main skin file.
