                <p class="about-me-text mt-3">This is a game engine written nearly from scratch in C with Vulkan and
                    SDL2 for my special topics course at NJIT. You may notice that this game is not in English! This is
                    because one of our deliverables was Polish. Now, you may read this as polish. But since I'm
                    <em>hilarious</em> I decided this meant the language AND refinement of the project.
                    The main requirements for this project were writing shaders, writing our own physics and collisions
                    systems, figuring out a 2D pipeline to overlay on the screen, importing 3D models and getting them
                    to animate (this project uses baked animation meshes rather than armatures with deformation), as
                    well as implementing an editor and saving/loading levels to/from JSON (and having Polish, of course).

                    Besides the actual rendering, this was one of the most complicated part of this project. While not
                    the most sophisticated system, it does its job well. Every object has an axis-aligned bounding box.
                    These boxes cannot rotate but may change size. Since this is only a platformer, the boxes did not
                    have to be very complex.

                <p class="about-me-text mt-2">
                    For animating, each object has their amount of frames and what models to use for the frames defined
                    in their mob definition file. The game then flips through these models at a specified rate to show
                    the animations. Figuring out armature animation was hard for me to do in the approximately two months
                    I had to work on this project so this was a good compromise.
                    <br>These models and animations are ripped from League of Legends. I applied the animations and
                    exported each frame as an OBJ from Blender.

                    The editor, much like the one in <a href="../projects/2DEngine_new.html">my 2D engine</a>, was one of
                    the class' favorites. Here, you can place objects, move them around, undo, and save your level.
                    These levels are stored in JSON format and can easily be saved and loaded.

                <p class="about-me-text mt-2">
                    The enemies in this game fall into three categories: jumper, circler, and pacer. The jumper (with
                    the Blitzcrank model) always follows the player, bouncing as it moves forward. The circler (with the
                    red minion model) circles in place until the player gets near it. Upon getting near, it will chase
                    the player until they get far enough away, upon which it will start circling again. The pacer (with
                    the penguin model) bounces back and forth until hitting a ledge. When it hits a ledge it will bounce
                    off and start going the opposite direction.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-4">Goal (Mushrooms)</h4>
                <img alt="experience bar" class="img-fluid about-me-img1 center mt-1" src="../images/projects/vulkan/vulkan_7_mushrooms.png">
                <p class="about-me-text mt-2 mb-5">
                    The goal of each level is to collect mushrooms. Once you collect enough mushrooms you go to the next
                    level (as defined in the level's JSON file). Every editor level also must have at least one mushroom
                    or else it won't save.
                </p>

                <img alt="experience bar" class="img-fluid about-me-img1 center mt-1" src="../images/projects/vulkan/vulkan_9_powerups.png">
                <p class="about-me-text mt-2 mb-5">
                    There are two powerups in the game. These are the spring and boost. The spring makes you jump
                    higher and the boost makes you move and sprint faster.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-4">Built From Scratch With Vulkan</h4>
                <img alt="experience bar" class="img-fluid about-me-img1 center mt-1" src="../images/projects/vulkan/vulkan_8_code.png">
                <p class="about-me-text mt-2 mb-5">
                    The bread and butter of this project, all 3D and 2D rendering is done with Vulkan then passed to
                    SDL2 for display. I worked with pipelines, shaders, and other Vulkan elements in order to not only
                    acquire the best graphics device but also make sure the program runs well. I learned a great deal
                    about the ins and outs of rendering, such as swapchains and buffers and how data is moved from the
                    CPU to the GPU.
