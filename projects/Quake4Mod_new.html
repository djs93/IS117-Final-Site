                <p class="about-me-text mt-3">This is a mod for the game Quake 4, originally released in 2005 by Raven Software and id Software.
                    The theme of this mod is League of Legends in Quake 4. Currently, there are 5 different classes,
                    each with two upgradable abilities. The player also gains experience and gold upon killing enemies.
                    All of these stats and selections also persist through levels and get saved/loaded from save files!
                    One of the most challenging parts of this mod was having a buy menu pop up so the player could
                    purchase items and upgrade their abilities. It was my first dive into what true game production
                    looks like, and helped me develop the other projects on this page.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-center mt-3">Features</h2>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-4">Custom Selection Menus</h4>
                <div class="row justify-content-center mt-1">
                    <img alt="class selection window" class="img-fluid selection-img" src="../images/projects/quake4/q4_1.png">

                <p class="about-me-text mt-2">
                    By far the most complicated part of the project, these menus are the thing I'm most proud of for this
                    project. I took seemingly scrapped code for an item shop from the multiplayer mode code and reverse
                    engineered it in order to figure out how it worked. Then, I rewrote parts of it in order to make it
                    work in single player. I made two separate selection windows: one for class selection, and one for
                    the item shop. Again, this was one of the most technical changes in this entire mod and it feels
                    so good to have gotten it working how I wanted it to!

                <p class="about-me-text mt-2">
                    When the player first spawns in, they must select a class. Each class has two abilities and different
                    stats, such as health and damage. The available classes implemented are Tank, Assassin, Mage,
                    Marksman (my personal favorite), and Support.

                    Every class has two abilities, each modifying some aspect of weapons originally in Quake 4 in order
                    to theme them similar to abilities in League of Legends. Instead of listing them all in text, here's
                    a table that describes them:
